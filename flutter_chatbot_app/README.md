# 🌾 SisaBerkat

**Malaysia's First Smart Surplus Ecosystem**

SisaBerkat is more than an online platform — it's a transformative movement where surplus becomes sustenance, and leftovers turn into livelihoods. We bring together farmers, communities, and youth entrepreneurs to create impact through rescued harvests and unused food.
